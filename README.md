# üßÆ FibMatrix: An Android Application for O(log n) Fibonacci Computation

**FibMatrix** is a contemporary Android application, developed exclusively with **Jetpack Compose**, which functions as an interactive, visual compendium for mastering the **O(log n)** matrix exponentiation algorithm used for calculating Fibonacci numbers.

This application is engineered not merely as a utility, but as an **educational resource** to facilitate a deeper comprehension among students and engineers regarding the rationale and implementation of this powerful and prevalent technical interview algorithm.

<pre>
| 1  1 |
| 1  0 |
</pre>
</p>

### üßÆ Computational Sandbox

The application's central utility. Users may input any integer `n` to instantly compute:

- The Fibonacci number `F(n)`
- The final matrix `M‚Åø`
- A comparative visualization of **O(n)** vs **O(log n)** computational complexity

### üî¨ O(log n) Recursion Trace

A visual tracer for the `power(M, n)` function, designed to elucidate the **exponentiation by squaring** methodology.

### üìä Dynamic Complexity Chart

An interactive bar chart, rendered via the **Vico** library, quantitatively illustrating the performance disparity between the two algorithmic approaches.

### üíª Algorithm-Source Display

A syntax-highlighted presentation of the complete Java algorithm, formatted for readability.

### üåó Dual-Theme UI

Implemented with **Material 3** components, featuring a polished, responsive interface that adapts to light and dark themes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Technical Implementation

This project demonstrates **modern Android development best practices**, featuring a clean and scalable software architecture.

### 1. Architecture: Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìViewModel (MVVM)

**ViewModel (`FibonacciViewModel.kt`)**  
Encapsulates all business logic, computation, and state management. Validates user input (e.g., ensuring numerical range safety) for application stability.

**View (`screens/*.kt`)**  
Stateless `@Composable` functions organized as screens. They observe state from the ViewModel and communicate user actions via a `UiEvent` system (e.g., `SandboxCalculate`).

**Model (`UiState.kt`)**  
A single immutable `UiState` data class represents the complete application state, managed via a `StateFlow`.

---

### 2. UI: Declarative Interface with Jetpack Compose

- **Fully Declarative:** The UI is built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**, including navigation and matrix visualizations.
- **Material 3:** Adheres to the latest Material Design 3 guidelines for components, color systems, and typography (`theme/Theme.kt`).
- **Custom Layouts:** `MatrixDisplay` and `VectorDisplay` composables manage complex, dynamic data layouts with proper alignment and scrollable overflow using a custom `EquationBox`.
- **State-Driven Recomposition:** Efficient recomposition occurs only when `UiState` changes.

---

### 3. State Management

- **Unidirectional Data Flow (UDF):**  
  State flows downward (ViewModel ‚Üí UI) and events propagate upward (UI ‚Üí ViewModel).
- **StateFlow:**  
  A private `MutableStateFlow` manages the internal state, exposed as immutable `StateFlow<UiState>` for UI consumption.
- **UiEvent Sealed Class:**  
  Defines all user interactions as discrete events, ensuring traceability and a clean ViewModel API.

---

### 4. Navigation

The app uses `androidx.navigation:navigation-compose` within a **Single-Activity** architecture.

**`AppNavigation.kt`:**  
A centralized `NavHost` component manages all screen transitions and navigational logic.

---

### 5. Third-Party Library Integration

- **Vico (Charting):** Demonstrates integration and customization of the [Vico charting library](https://github.com/patrykandpatryk/vico).  
  Includes a custom `ChartDisplay` composable with:
  - Custom axis labels (_O(n)_ vs _O(log n)_)
  - Integer-only Y-axis formatting
  - Persistent data labels for each bar

## üí° Algorithmic Foundation: Matrix Exponentiation

The application's core logic is based on the following matrix identity:

<p align="center">
<pre>
| F(n+1) |   =   | 1  1 | √ó | F(n)   |
|  F(n)  |       | 1  0 |   | F(n‚àí1) |
</pre>
</p>

This relationship can be extended through induction to yield:

<p align="center">
<pre>
| F(n)   |   =   | 1  1 |^(n‚àí1) √ó | F(1) |
| F(n‚àí1) |       | 1  0 |         | F(0) |
</pre>
</p>

Consequently, `F(n)` can be determined by computing the `(n‚àí1)`th power of the matrix:

<p align="center">
<pre>
M = | 1  1 |
    | 1  0 |
</pre>
</p>

A naive approach would require `n‚àí1` multiplications (**O(n)** time).  
This app implements **exponentiation by squaring**, reducing it to **O(log n)** time.  
The algorithm uses `BigInteger` to handle large Fibonacci values.
